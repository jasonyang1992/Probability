# Probability
Java probability

Methods
1. addBag - use this method to pass a success and fail rate. Example 30 success 70 failure would create 30 % success rate since the total success and failure rate is 100 (30/100)
2. clearBag - clears the inserted success and fail rate created by add bag. It is then ready for a new set of success and fail rates.
3. toString - Overridden string method to return whether if is a success or fail
